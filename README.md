Java-Image-Processor
====================

A very basic paint program made in java

Supports:
- brush, eraser, line, rectangle, ellipse, and bucket tools
- [transparency and layers](http://a.pomf.se/afcyef.png)
- file [saving](http://a.pomf.se/acnvih.png) and [opening](http://a.pomf.se/aowlxd.png)
- some features not yet implemented (cut/copy/paste, box select, undo/redo, layer moving/deleting, image resizing)

FULL DISCLAIMER: I made this early in my University life and before I learned what a design pattern is. I'm mostly keeping it for cringe/memorabilia reasons.
